# Black Market Auction House Checker App V1

This is a tool to check what Black Market Auction House on Wow's Area-52 shard has to offer.  

This version of the tool was built to utilize Sinatra so I could build a slim Web App.  It's currently Deployed on [Heroku](https://ancient-sands-53368.herokuapp.com/).  FYI: It may take a few seconds to spin up Heroku, depending on how long it's been since the app was pinged.

_This is currently only configured to work with Area 52_

Requirements:
Bundler
